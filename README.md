# GOST-R Crypto Extension Task Group

This repository represents an administrative repository for the GOST-R Crypto Extension Task Group 
(TG).  

It should contain documents to facilitate the group function, e.g. meeting minutes and supporting documents.
It should not contain code nor specifications.

This community will develop an optional ISA extension for specific Russian national symmetric cryptography 
("Kuznyechik", "Magma", and "Streebog") on both RV32 and RV64. The deliverables match CETG Definition-of-Done: 
Technical rationale, ISA definitions, specification document, architectural compatibility tests, SAIL, opcode allocation, 
compiler support.
